## **Mission Objectives**

- Be able to work with computer vision libraries, and techniques to remove the background on images
- Be able to explore the pre-trained models for background removal on image and videos
- Be able to create and deploy a quality background removal API
- Be able to use Neural Networks and Machine Learning models
- Be able to deploy the models for end customers

## **About The Repository**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60827480/121079465-6ec2f300-c7da-11eb-80ab-e69e244c9775.png)

<p align="justify">
One of our partner companies gave us a usecase to use Deep Learning technologies to remove the image background of an image. There are already a lot of pretrained models available but our partner would like to have the better quality of the results on the images.
</p>
<p align="justify">The goal is to train our own model or use transfer learning to create a model that can give a quality result and also a result that is fast and reliable. We were given the [DUTS Image dataset](http://saliencydetection.net/duts/) to train and test on and also 15 High Quality images that the client chose.</p>

<p align="justify"> ------ Conclusion here -----
</p>
<p align = "justify">This project is currently deployed locally, if you wanted to try to run this on your own and you dont have a GPU on your computer, you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) as it needs a lot of computing power.</p>

## **Libraries Used For This Project**

**OpenCV** https://opencv.org/

- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.
- In this project, OpenCV is used to read the image and calculate the erosion and dilation for the trimap

**Keras** https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/

- Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear & actionable error messages.
- In this project, Keras is used to create the model easier

**Flask** https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/

- Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries
- In this project, flask is used to create the web dashboard application
